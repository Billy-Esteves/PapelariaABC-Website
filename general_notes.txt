To run a given class:

1 - Call any methods for quick testing wither in the main/start methods or in the "protected [class name]" method at the top of the code

2 - Run a given class with : mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.website.[name of the class]"
(for example, for the DatabaseManager): mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.website.DatabaseManager"

To confirm that ports are being used by registrires, in powershel terminal type: netstat -ano | findstr :[port number]

3 - In a Java distributed system, the choice between having a main() method and a start() method depends on the role and responsibility of the class in your architecture:

Use public static void main(String[] args) when:
    - The class is the entry point of a standalone application or service.
    - You run it directly (e.g., via command line or java command).
    - You want to bootstrap an entire node/component (e.g., a website server, RMI registry, admin client).

Use a start() method when:
    - The class is part of a larger system and not the main entry point.
    - It's a service/component that should be started by another controller (e.g., an AdminClient).
    - You want to start/stop it dynamically, possibly from another class or over the network.

Both DatabaseManager and GatewayServer need registries of their own. this is so they can run on different machines.

General flow:

1 - DatabaseManager starts up and creates its own registry, creating an instance of itself
that will be bound to the registry, so others can use it through its stub.
2 - GatewayServer starts up, binds itself on DatabaseManager's registry and creates
one of its own aswell, creating an instance of itself so it can be bou d to the registry and
used by others.
It then has a variable to hold the databaseManager interface and set it to the stub of the
database registry.
4 - WebsiteController starts up and binds itself on GatewayServer's registry.
Web clients interact with the web application (Spring Boot), managed by WebsiteController
5 - AdminClient connects directly to GatewayServer through RMI.

Each can be in its own respective machine.
